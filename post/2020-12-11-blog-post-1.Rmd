# Blog Post 1

## Python

For my first blog post, I utilized the flights dataset demonstrate its use within Python functionality. The Python code demonstrates some of the programming fundamentals for basic usage and analysis of data using regular expressions.

```{R}
library(reticulate)
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
flights <- as.data.frame(flights)
```

## Mean, Minimum, and Maximum of flight distances
```{python}
r.flights.distance.mean()
r.flights.distance.min()
r.flights.distance.max()
```
![](/post/2020-12-11-blog-post-1_files/Density-Map-of-Flights-over-the-US-24-Hours-of-Traffic-in-January-2004-6.png)
Here is a density map that shows the most common flight paths within the United States to show how often people travel certain distances withing the U.S.
```{python}
import pandas as pd
r.flights["distance"].describe()
```

## Mean, Minimum, and Maximum of flight air times
```{python}
import numpy as np
r.flights.air_time.mean()
r.flights.air_time.min()
r.flights.air_time.max()
r.flights["air_time"].describe()
np.mean(r.flights[r.flights.distance>1039.91].air_time)
np.mean(r.flights[r.flights.distance<1039.91].air_time)
```
```{python}
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('pdf')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.hist(r.flights.air_time)
plt.show()
```
Histogram depicts the proportion of flights for various air times.

## Mean of flight arrival delays and departure delays
```{python}
r.flights.arr_delay.mean()
r.flights.dep_delay.mean()
```

## Regex
Using the regular expression function in Python on a string that I made up, using real facts, I extracted the destination airports.
```{python}
import re
string="Most high earning flights from DFW travel to LAX, ORD, SYD, ATL, LGW, in order."
re.findall(r"\w\w\w\W\s", string)
```

## Final Reticulate
This definitively shows how R can communicate with Python. In this example, I combine an R expression with a Python expression that explains where the airports extracted using the regular expression above are located.
```{R}
flights_str <- "Flights from DFW that generate the most $$ travel to"
```
```{python}
destinations="Los Angeles, Chicago, Sydney, Atlanta, and London"
print(r.flights_str,destinations)

```
